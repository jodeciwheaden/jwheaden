Jodeci Wheaden is a Software Engineer at MITRE and a current Northeastern graduate student. She received her undergraduate degree from Georgia College & State University in December 2014. The decision to obtain a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Mathematics was made because of its universal nature and its reoccurrence in many other fields of study. 

After the completion of her undergraduate degree, she decided to become a teacher in an effort to be a positive influence and to alleviate the gap in mathematics. During her teaching career, she was feeding her passion for technology until the opportunity arose for her to study computer science full time. March 1, 2019 her life took a monumental turn when she learned that she had been awarded the Full GEM Fellowship. A fellowship known for helping underrepresented ethnic groups pursue their graduate degrees in STEM majors. 

Northeastern was her first choice of universities to attend because of their specialized computer science master's program for individuals that did not obtain an undergraduate degree in that field of study. MITRE was her gift whose motto is "Solving Problems For a Safer World," which is a motivating factor for her each and every day. These were her sponsoring GEM company and university and with these two power entities behind her she knew her dreams were limitless.  

A degree in computer science will allow her to have the resources to demonstrate to the future generations the importance of STEM and more importantly the versatility that a computer science degree possesses.
